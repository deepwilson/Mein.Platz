This is because the issues you came across and the mistakes you made are still fresh in your mind and the resources you consulted to overcome/correct those issues/mistakes are still fresh in you mind and close to hand.\n",

Thus, I initially assumed that all I needed to do was put all my comments for a project together, edit and format them into a coherent document, and voila!, blog post.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, the various resources I found online for creating simple blogs were overly involved and required knowledge of html and other web-related stuff of which I knew nothing. Furthermore, I wasn't interested in going off on a tangent when my focus is `Machine Learning` and `Computer Vision`. I alos came across [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) at this point but it was more of the same.\n",
