        Life, as is

    </h1>
     
    
    
    <div>
A little push is all I need
These little bruises I can't pay heed
To keep moving is all I aim
My deep hidden fears to tame
The final destination 
Is it worth?
Or these little pleasures 
In my hearth

To leap or to take small steps
The front pages or - a blank verse
Away from the flock or with the crowd
Questions echo my mind aloud

But..
To the anxious mind pay no heed
To flow with the stream is all you need
To be wayfarers of life let's strive 
For come what may we will thrive
