    <div>
        Dragged to my knees
    Silhouettes visible through the strands of my hair
    Judged by the hypocrites
    Invitation to the devil's lair
    
    Soul impure
    Loathe endured
    A'gain I find myself impure
    
    Played with my bosom at night
    Stayed away in broad day light
    The mask of righteousness you wear
    Reveal your true ill self I dare
    
    My time I knew sss'about to end
    But wait, I see the man ahead
    His gaze below engrossed in scrawl
    I saw my Ray of hope befall
    
    
    With auth-o-rity he raised his voice
    The one who has not sinned - assault!!
    The stones that were ..
    raised to destroy
    Dropped to the ground
    Wiped out their ploy
    
    Soul impure
    Loathe endured
    No more sorrow.. I will endure !
