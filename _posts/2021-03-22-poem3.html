    Back to pieces!
    </l>
    </h1>  
    <div>
A cherished dream
Hopes in ream
Fight for survival 
Urge to scream
 
Cries in despair
What holds ahead
Give up i may
It's not destined they say
 
Back to pieces 
Fate's huge cane
To hold it whole
Attempts in vain
 
End this agony 
No longer a pain
Guess this is it
Back to pieces again
 
My hearts desire
Alive as a flame
Fanned by reasons
You cannot explain
 
Don't worry mom
Don't be sad 
For you know
I'm your little lad
 
 
Just another falling leaf I am
A little happiness a little much grief I had
    </div>
