This folder contains posts (.ipynb & .md) which I am still working on or don't want uploaded to GitHub.

## What To Do Next?

Great!  You have setup your repo.  Now its time to start writing content.  Some helpful links:

- [Writing Blogs With Jupyter](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages#writing-blog-posts-with-jupyter)
- [Writing Blogs With Markdown](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages#writing-blog-posts-with-markdown)
- [Writing Blog Posts With Word](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages#writing-blog-posts-with-microsoft-word)
- [(Optional) Preview Your Blog Locally](_fastpages_docs/DEVELOPMENT.md)

Note: you may want to remove example blog posts from the `_posts`,  `_notebooks` or `_word` folders (but leave them empty, don't delete these folders) if you don't want these blog posts to appear on your site.

Please use the [nbdev & blogging channel](https://forums.fast.ai/c/fastai-users/nbdev/48) in the fastai forums for any questions or feature requests.
