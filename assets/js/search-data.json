            "title": "Draft_ Setting Up This Blog Using fastpages",
            "content": ". Setting Up This Blog Using fastpages . . Background . . You can skip over this **Background** section. I went off for a while here. Over the course of this year when I got deeper into Machine Learning and Computer Vision, I started to come across posts and comments advising folks new to programming in general to create a blog detailing their journey. The benefits of creating such a blog could be summed up as: . You are presently in the best position to help along another newcomer who is a few steps behind you. This is because the issues you came across and the mistakes you made are still fresh in your mind and the resources you consulted to overcome/correct those issues/mistakes are still fresh in you mind and close to hand. | It is generally agreed that writing about a topic helps deepen your understanding of the topic and force you to address the gaps in your knowledge. | You write for totally selfish reasons. You write for posterity. You write for your future self. | . Given the schools of thought I was exposed to while learning programming and my personal way of doing things, my code is always littered with detailed and sometimes superfluous comments. Thus, initially it seemed all I needed to do was put all my comments for a project together, edit and format into a coherent document and voila! blog post. . Unfortunately, the various resources I found online for creating simple blogs were overly involved and required knowledge of html and other web-related stuff of which I knew nothing. Furthermore, I wasn’t interested in going on a tangent when my focus id Machine Learning and Computer Vision. I come across GitHub Pages at this point but it was more of the same. . So, I gave up on creating a blog and stuck to writing detailed comments in my code. . Then I took fast.ai’s Practical Deep Learning for Coders online course. At some point in Lesson 3, when Jeremy Howard started going on about writing and blogs, I went all “Here we go again.” Then he introduced {fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages) and it was all I ever needed. . Create a blog using jupyter notenooks and markdown files? Take my money!!! . . Introducing fastpages . fastpages is an easy to use blogging platform, with support for Jupyter notebooks, Word docs, and Markdown. . . fastpages uses GitHub Actions to simplify the process of creating Jekyll blog posts on GitHub Pages from a variety of input formats. . See the fastpages GitHub repository for a more detailed list of features. . . **[See the demo site.](https://fastpages.fast.ai/)** . Initial Setup . The initial setup is totally straightforeward and effortless. The setup instructions are detailed and there is even a walkthrough on YouTube if that wasn’t enough. . It wasn’t enough for me. There was part of the setup where I needed to merge a pull request but I somehow didn’t see that line in the instructions. . With the setup instructions and YouTube walkthrough, you can’t go wrong. If you, go through either of them again, slowly. You most definitely missed something. . Customizing Your Blog . Once you’re done with the intial setup, you’ll get a generic blog that contains a few placeholders from fastbook. There are a few simple changes you can make to put your personal stamp on your blog. . These changes can be implemented across three files in you new blog repository. I will list the files and the personalizations that can be done in each. . index.html . This file is responsible for the the content of the blog’s homepage – between the top bar and the Posts section. The picture below shows the code and the result in the homepage. . . Two sets of changes can be made in this file: . Line 4: The blog logo by sepecified by a file placed in the images folder of the base directory. This is the image preview automatically shown with your blog URL on social media sites. You can either: replace the fastpages logo with one of your own choosing, leaving Line 4 as it is; or | add you own file to the images folder and edit the filename in Line 4. | . . The image must be in the **images** folder (or subfolders) for your blog to render correctly. | &lt;/div&gt; . Lines 6-14: Everything here can be removed and replaced with content of your choosing. From my experience, the content can be in html format or markdown format or a mix of both formats. | README.md . Theis file is responsible for the content of the blog’s github repository page – after the folders and files have been listed. . . Two sets of changes can be made to this file: . Line 6: You can totally remove that line, thus removing the View Demo Site badge. On the other hand, you might want to change it to one of your choosing and make it point to another link. . This is quite simple. The shields.io developer site contains example code on how to create your own custom badges. . If you want to use a shield logo other than the ones available, you need to convert your png to base64 code. You can’t just specify a path to the .png file. b64.io is a free resource for converting images to base64 format. The logo is then specified in the badge code using the snippet below. . ?logo=data:image/png;base64,… . You can consult the answers provided to this stackoverflow question if you have any difficulty creating you custom badge. You can create any number of badge this way, all with different attributes. . | Lines 7-554: Everything here can be removed and replaced with content of your choosing. The content has to be in markdown format. . | _config.yml . This is the main configuration file for the blog. This file should be edited carefully as any mistakes will cause errors when GutHub tries to build your blog. The main fastpages README.md provides detailed information on what parts of the blog the parameters in this file control. . However, since we’re talking about simple customizations, here are some: . Line 9: This controls the title of the blog found at the top of the homepage. It is freely customizable. | Line 10: This controls the blog description at the very bottom of the homepage. It is freely customizable. | Lines 39-43: Here you can add links you your social media accounts and other professional accounts. This link provides the list if supported social networks and their keys. | Line 52: This controls the display image previews on home page, for posts that have them. It is set to false by default. You should try it out, it’s a good look. | images . This folder contains images necessary for customizing the look of the blog’s URL. There are a couple of changes you can make here. . logo.png: As stated earlier, this specfies the image preview can be automatically shown with your URL on social media sites. This is freely ccustomizable. | favicon.ico: This controls the page icon shown on the browser tab when the site is opened in browser. There are lots of free resources for downloading .ico file or converting your .png to .ico. . . From my experience, the file name must be **favicon.ico**. | . &lt;/div&gt; . pages/about.md . This file is responsible for the the content of the blog’s About Me page – found on right-side of the top bar. The picture below shows the code and the result on the blog. . . Everything from Lines 7-12 can be removed and replaced with content of your choosing. The content has to be in markdown format. . That’s about it for simple ccustomizations’ you can make your blog at first go. . . Further Customizations . Here are some other advanced customizations you can carry out. They are advanced in the sense that you need to go through the documentation of the various resources used by fastpages in order to figure out to to modify them. . At this point, you’ll be diverging greatly from the default fastpages setup for your blog, thus you’ll need to modify/add multiple files to successfully make a modification. . . Further Links . Here are some useful links the I coudn’t add in the main post: . | | | | . . . .",

            "title": "An Example Markdown Post",
            "content": "Example Markdown Post . Basic setup . Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format: . YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md . Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code . You can format text and code per usual . General preformatted text: . Do a thing . do_thing() Python code and output: . # Prints &#39;2&#39; print(1+1) . 2 Formatting text as shell commands: . echo &quot;hello world&quot; ./some_script.sh --option &quot;value&quot; wget https://example.com/cat_photo1.png . Formatting text as YAML: . key: value - another_key: &quot;another value&quot; . Tables . Column 1 Column 2 . A thing | Another thing | . Tweetcards .

Three times is enemy action.” . ― Ian Fleming . “Tradition is a set of solutions for which we have forgotten the problems” . ― Donald Kingsbury . “People fear death even more than pain. It&#39;s strange that they fear death. Life hurts a lot more than death. At the point of death, the pain is over. Yeah, I guess it is a friend.” . ― Jim Morrison . “There is something profoundly cynical, my friends, in the notion of paradise after death. The lure is evasion. The promise is excusative. One need not accept responsibility for the world as it is, and by extension, one need do nothing about it. To strive for change, for true goodness in this mortal world, one must acknowledge and accept, within one&#39;s own soul, that this mortal reality has purpose in itself, that its greatest value is not for us, but for our children and their children. To view life as but a quick passage along a foul, tortured path - made foul and tortured by our own indifference - is to excuse all manner of misery and depravity, and to exact cruel punishment upon the innocent lives to come.I defy this notion of paradise beyond the gates of bone. If the soul truly survives the passage, then it behooves us - each of us, my friends - to nurture a faith in similitude: what awaits us is a reflection of what we leave behind, and in the squandering of our mortal existence, we surrender the opportunity to learn the ways of goodness, the practice of sympathy, empathy, compassion and healing - all passed by in our rush to arrive at a place of glory and beauty, a place we did not earn, and most certainly do not deserve.”The Apocryphal Teachings of Tanno Spiritwalker Kimloc; The Decade in Ehrlitan . ― Steven Erikson, The Bonehunters . “If you&#39;re harmless, you&#39;re not virtuous. You&#39;re just harmless. You&#39;re like a rabbit. A rabbit isn&#39;t virtuous. It can&#39;t do anything but get eaten.If you&#39;re a monster and you don&#39;t act monstrous, then you&#39;re virtuous. ” . ― Jordan B. Peterson . “Pity those who want the perfect life! Break me, tear me apart, let me be beaten and altered by life, let my life be touched and touch in return for I will be Human, for there is no reason on earth to be scared of yourself.Perfect is boring... let it be written in the sky, painted on buildings, read with your eyes, transcribed on your soul.” . ― Unknown . “Just because fate has chosen something for you instead of you choosing it for yourself doesn’t mean it has to be bad. Even if it’s something you are sure you would never have chosen in a hundred years.” . ― Robert Jordan, The Dragon Reborn . “The Wheel of Time turns, and ages come and pass, leaving memories that become legend. Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth comes again. In one Age, called the Third Age by some, an Age yet to come, an Age long past, a wind rose in the Mountains of Mist. The wind was not the beginning. There are neither beginnings nor endings to the turning of the Wheel of time. But it was a beginning.” . ― Robert Jordan, The Eye of the World . “A young wolfhound must meet his first wolf someday, but if the wolf sees him as a puppy, if he acts the puppy, the wolf will surely kill him. The wolfhound must be a wolfhound in the wolf&#39;s eyes even more than in his own, if he is to survive.” . ― Robert Jordan, The Great Hunt . “There are no atheists in foxholes. In the end, everyone prays.” . ― Unknown .",
